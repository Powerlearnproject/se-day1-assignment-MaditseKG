   - **Milestone**: The development of structured programming, championed by figures like Edsger W. Dijkstra, introduced clear, logical ways of organizing code with defined flow structures (e.g., loops, conditionals). This laid the groundwork for more maintainable and reliable software.

  3. Agile Methodology (2000s):
   - Context: Traditional software development methods, such as the Waterfall model, often led to slow, rigid processes and delayed product delivery.
   - Milestone: The introduction of Agile methodologies, formalized with the Agile Manifesto in 2001, emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, allowing teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software faster.
These milestones represent major shifts in how software development is approached, making systems more reliable, maintainable, and adaptable over time.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases that guide the development of software from start to finish. Here are the key phases:
   1. Planning:
   - Explanation: This phase involves defining the project scope, goals, resources, timeline, and budget. It's about understanding what the software should achieve and how it will be built.

   2. Requirements Gathering and Analysis:
   - Explanation: In this phase, developers and stakeholders gather and analyze the requirements for the software, including user needs, functional specifications, and system constraints. The goal is to create a clear understanding of what the software should do.

   3. Design:
   - Explanation: This phase involves planning the system architecture and design. It focuses on how the software will meet the requirements, covering aspects like system architecture, database design, and user interface design.

   4. Implementation (Coding):
   - Explanation: Developers write the code based on the design specifications. This phase is where the actual software is built, using programming languages and tools.

   5. Testing:
   - Explanation: The software is tested to ensure that it works as expected. This phase involves identifying and fixing bugs or issues, ensuring the software meets the requirements and is free from errors.

   6. Deployment:
   - Explanation: Once the software is tested, it's deployed to the production environment where it becomes accessible to users. It may be released in phases or all at once.

   7. Maintenance:
   - Explanation: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves fixing bugs, making updates, and adding new features as necessary to keep the software running smoothly.
- These phases form a structured approach to software development, ensuring that each aspect is carefully planned, executed, and reviewed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
